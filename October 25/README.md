# Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.

For this assignment, I want to choose a robot from Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot". Namely, Robbie from the first story in the book. Robbie is a care-giver robot that looks after the child, Gloria, while her parents are busy. Robbie is known to be affectionate and kind-willed; ultimately, Robbie "isn't designed for engineering or construction work". He "pantomimes" and "cannot run", according to the original story (Asimov 2). Most importantly, Robbie adheres to the laws of robotics that Asimov created for the book:
1.  A robot shall not harm a human, or by inaction allow a human to come to harm.
2.  A robot shall obey any instruction given to it by a human.
3.  A robot shall avoid actions or situations that could cause it to come to harm itself.

Robbie's top quality from the story is that he doesn't look or act like a typical robot, "he is not a machine...he was a friend" (Asimov 11). The story ends when Robbie saves Gloria's life from a tractor incident. 

## - How will you construct the actor to create the role?

Given Robbie's qualities, it would make sense to give him anthropomorphic form that will give out sense of trust, kindness, and appeal to children.

## - What technical features will the actor need?

Robbie will have the ability to move his legs and arms. He will have to be expressive to show empathy and other emotions. And he has to be able to react fast in urgent situations to be able to save children that he is taking care of.

## - How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?

In terms of clothing, I do not think Robbie will require anything special aside from his anthropomorphic physique. I may add some clothing to add to his portrayal of a care-giver.

## - What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?

Robbie will definitely have a face -- perhaps a neopixel board? I will need to program a sequence of events to showcase his empathy and care-giver skills, as well as a trigger for him to act fast and save Gloria from a potential catastrophe.
