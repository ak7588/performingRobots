2. Propose an idea for a robot play or a scene from a play.

Play idea: when thinking of the proposal, I immediately started to think of plays with dogs, because we have Boston Dynamics. However, it just struck me that BD dogs don't have to play dogs?! They can play any character! So this is why I started to think of my last week's proposal and specifically how to incorporate other robots in it.

My idea was to put a play on the first chapter of "I, Robot" by A. Asimov. In this play, there are two parents and a factory robot/machine that is of a potential danger to the girl. So a Boston Dynamic robodog can play the dangerous machine in this case, and then my own robots comes to save the girl from the danger.

Utilizing the idea of continuity and interaction from this weekend's reading, I think all of the robots should be reactive to each other's presense, though I don't yet know how exactly this will come to live. Timed responses will also be of an advantage for the robotic play.
