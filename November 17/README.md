# Notes and Questions on Digital Theatre by Nadja Masura (Chapter 6 "The ‘Other’ Actor")

````"It may be that in some future time that all actors will be replaced by androids and hologram projections and human emotions are regularly simulated by computer programs for our viewing pleasure." (131)````

With the development of technical alogrithms and animation software, I actually do think that computer agents will take a big place in the future of cinema, if not already. However, it does not make sense to eliminate human actors completely, as there is something to human presense that makes us appreciate art.

````By mentally retracing the human form beside its digital other co-star, we allow ourselves to ponder the Actor’s body as a locus of meaning—as the common unit of human experience, and situate ourselves within the larger unfolding discussion between the human (organic) and the artificial (man-made). (132)````

This text raises a lot of interesting points, such as the quote above. How do we get the balance between two types of actors? Who decides whose the role will be, if both human and robot are auditioning? What about the roles that include a mix of computer and human actors, for example computer-generated look and human-generated voice and motion?

````“[Robot] will stop at a specified magnification of desired size, speed and astonishing liquidity”````

Robots are certainly more precise than humans, which gives them advantage in complex roles. But robots also produce a lot of bugs. How do we assure the best quality of the technical devices used to minimize any mistakes?
