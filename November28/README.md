# "He who does his work in a manner of a machine lets his mind run like a machine" (3).

Starting the reading with this quote had me a bit perplexed about the definition of a robot. If humans suddenly started to follow algorithms for everything we do (not to say that we already aren't) -- would that make us machines, too?

So, what is a traditional Freudian robot anyways? A flawless machine that executes commands? What is a "neurotic machine"? Can human be a "neurotic machine"? :)

More questions than answers...looking forward to the class discussion and hearing the rest of opinions on this!
