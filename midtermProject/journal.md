# Midterm Project Journal

## Idea:

Expressive robot that can move with two motors, change its eye color, move its hands and make sounds depending on its mood. The goal is to make the robot move forward, have green eyes, and play pleasant music notes while it has a great mood. Whenever robot has a bad mood, it will have red eyes, it stops moving forward, starts shaking hands, and plays angry sounds.

## October 2nd, 2021:
- Started to work on the project: developed the idea, build a simple circuit with two motors, two servos, and the neopixel board.

- Broke my second Arduino, so will have to replace. Here's a video I took just before it broke:

Actionable items for next time:
- Get a working Arduino.
- Connect the audio/sound sensor.
- Write simple code to test the robot expressions.


## October 3rd, 2021:
- Made my Arduino work (there was a short circuit!)
- Connected the audio buzzer and tested basic music notes playing
- (Re)connected servo motors and made sure they work
- Started to write some basic code for the robot to execute (HUGE milestone: debugged the "delay()" issue and wrote code with millis() instead)

Actionable items for next time:
- Code the neopixel board
- Right now all of the devices work in separate, next time I want to make sure when they all work together nothing breaks
- Start working on the robot appearance if the code is ok
