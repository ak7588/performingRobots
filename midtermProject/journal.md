# Midterm Project Journal

## Idea:

Expressive robot that can move with two motors, change its eye color, move its hands and make sounds depending on its mood. The goal is to make the robot move forward, have green eyes, and play pleasant music notes while it has a great mood. Whenever robot has a bad mood, it will have red eyes, it stops moving forward, starts shaking hands, and plays angry sounds.

## October 2nd, 2021:
- Started to work on the project: developed the idea, build a simple circuit with two motors, two servos, and the neopixel board.
- Broke my second Arduino, so will have to replace.

Actionable items for next time:
- Get a working Arduino.
- Connect the audio/sound sensor.
- Write simple code to test the robot expressions.
