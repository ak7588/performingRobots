# Robot Design - Happy and Bashful
## Amina and Salama

### Dividing the robot
Part 1 (head): 
- Neopixel
- LED (diamond on the robots left hand)
- Have the ability switch between Happy and Bashful states → mainly Neopixel
- Also the ability to make the neopixel dim? (can be done with a potentiometer?)

Part 2 (body): 
- 1 Servo motor for right hand (controlled by potentiometer)
- 4 DC motors (controlled by 4 buttons)

Accessories:
- Costume (belt, hat)
- Axe
- Beard

Amina:
- Connect them to the design once everything works
- Neopixel and LED work

Salama 
- code the servo and motors to check that they work.
- build the design of the robot

### Components

1 or 2 servo motors
- To move the arm that will have a removable axe attached to it.
- The servo motor will move up and down continuously while pulling the string that is attached to the cardboard flap which will make the “hand” movement for the axe.


2 or 4 DC motors
- Controlled with the buttons

1 neopixel
- Displaying the characters emotion
- Changes from happy to bashful.
- Happy: :D (yellow?)
- Bashful: UwU (red?)

Additional decoration
- Dwarf hat
- White beard
- Hammer or other tools for the mine
- Belt

### Scenes

Scene 2 (inside the mine)
- Neopixel= happy
- Using the buttons to move our robot (DC)
- Pressing a button to make the robot move the axe (servo)
 
Scene 3 (meeting snow white)
- Enter house: Moving the robot with the buttons again (awkward movements for bashful)
- Neopixel= bashful
- Robots leaving: use buttons to move.


Scene 5 (find snow white asleep)
- Happy and moving
