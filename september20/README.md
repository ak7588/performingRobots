# Welcome Bob -- my first performing robot!

Firstly, let me define what is a robot. 

A robot is a programmed hardware that can perform a set of commands defined by the programmer. A robot *can* have a special physical appearance for a better audience impression, but it's not required to.

Here is the final (and the best of all) performances of Bob. Bob is just learning how to "walk" (drive) and is trying to move back and forth.
