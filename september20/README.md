# ðŸ¤– Welcome Bob - my first performing robot!

Firstly, let me define what is a robot. 

#### A robot is a programmed hardware that can perform a set of commands defined by the programmer. A robot *can* have a special physical appearance for a better audience impression, but it's not required to.

# ðŸ•º The Performance

Here is the final (and the best of all) performances of Bob. Bob is just learning how to "walk" (drive) and is trying to move back and forth. Hence the awkaradness in movements. Please be patient while Bob is taking his first steps.

# ðŸ”§ How it all works?

Now let's dive into the process. Before having the final version of my robot, I spent some time trying to (1) physically build a robot that can move with wheels, (2) write good code so that wheels can actually move.

Take a look at some of the failed attempts to build Bob:
