# Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents
## Reading Response

With an increasing human limitations and other factors in art performances, it is only expected that performing robots will take (over) some of these jobs. Autonomous robots use technologies that either difficult for humans to perform, like complex video and audio effects, or impossible, such as shared memory and A.I. functionality.

With these positive sides of autnomous agents in mind, I am curious if it is possible that performing robots are able to replace humans in arts from the agent-audience perspective. The answer would probably be *yes*: robots are more than capable of making art, as proved many times with GPT-2 algorithms and even *The Woggles*. It is clear from the paper that agent-agent and director-agent communication are effective in terms of technology.

However there undoubtedly will be need for *human* elements (I couldn't find a better term to describe it), such as emotions, thought-process, and even errors in some art fields. These might be replicable by robots and A.I., but oftentimes they are not considered to be "real". Then what makes a "real" human performance? To me, the director-agent performance would still count as somewhat real, as a human director is involved. 

I am more prone to think that in today's world the two types of performances (both human and robot) can co-exist and even complement each other. As the concept of performing robots is still new to humans, there is definitely an element of excitement and curiousity present when seeing robots perform -- the Boston Dynamics performance videos are a perfect example.
